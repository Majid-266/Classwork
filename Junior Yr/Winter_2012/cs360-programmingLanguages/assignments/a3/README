I separated the python scripts into part1.py and part2.py.
For part1.py I have the script compiling the dot code via the python os
class however for some reason the .png output from executing the command
this way gives a corrupt file.
If you compile the outputed dot file manually you can see it does output the
correct fsm diagram.
