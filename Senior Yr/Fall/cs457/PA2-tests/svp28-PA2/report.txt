This is a implementation of the A* algorithm, a heuristic based path finding algorithm.  In fact it's a guided BFS.  It is exponential in memory complexity because it has to keep all the nodes it has checked as well as new nodes it finds.  Since my heuristic function is optimatized A* will run in O(n) time complexity, n being k*k.

I have tested it with multiple puzzles and some that don't have solutions.  The program will check the number of intrusions and if it's a puzzle of width that is odd and the number of intrusions is even then it's solvable.
