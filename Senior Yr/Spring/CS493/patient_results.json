Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. It is administered intravenously. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure. ","indication": "For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the
prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in
patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to
unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.","pharmacology": "Bivalirudin directly and reversibly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding both to the catalytic site and to the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin.  The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin.

It contains 3 enzymes: amylase, lipase, and a protease (chymotrypsin). Pancrelipase is marketed under several brand names such as Ultresaâ„¢ and Viokaceâ„¢.","indication": "For treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis (Ultresaâ„¢), chronic pancreatitis (Viokaceâ„¢ in combination with a proton pump inhibitor), and pancreatectomy (Viokaceâ„¢ in combination with a proton pump inhibitor).   

","pharmacology": "Used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis or pancreatic dysfunction, pancrelipase helps improve fat digestion in the small intestine. Specifically, the lipase, protease and amylase components break down fat, protein, and starches, respectively, in the small intestine. Lipase hydrolyzes fats into glycerol and fatty acids. Protease converts proteins into proteoses and derived substances, while amylase converts starches into dextrins and sugars. Pancreatic enzymes are used to correct maldigestion, malabsorption and pain associated with pancreatic insufficiency. The major maldigestion/malabsorption problems arise from incomplete fat digestion. Exogenous pancrelipase reduces the amount of nitrogen and fat excreted in the stool.","dosage_id": 102,"drug_id": "DB00085","form": "Capsule, delayed release","route": "Oral","strength": "ULTRESA : 27,600USP UNITS; 13,800USP UNITS; 27,600USP UNITS (AMYLASE;LIPASE;PROTEASE) ","address_id": 17,"address1": "123 Broad Street","address2": "","apt_number": "","city": "Sellersville","state": "CT","zip_code": 12434}]
